# Oil Spill Detection in Trinidad and Tobago with SAR Data
This article investigates the February of 2024 oil spill in the coasts of the island of Tobago 5
using SAR. The objective of this study is to determine how SAR data can help to detect, quantify, 6
and monitor the progression of spills in a marine environment. Two sets of images were used cor- 7
responding to the 14th of February 2024 during the morning and night. The spill extended northwest 8
due to the marine currents and wind in the area. The morning observation showed a total area of 9
76.84 km2, in the subsequent night observation the total area was 50.49 km2. The findings ensure 10
the role of radar data as a powerful tool to address environmental disasters, their dynamics and 11
how can it be useful to respond rapidly to them.
